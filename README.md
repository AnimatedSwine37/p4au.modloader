# p4au.modloader
A Reloaded-II mod that makes it so any P4AU mods that use Reloaded's Universal File Redirector are automatically merged when you launch the game. This means you can use any number of mods that change the same pac (such as palette swaps) and they will automatically work together!

For details on how to use and install the mod please visit the [Gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/376984)
